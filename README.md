Classic Battleships game through command line

In the future I'm planning to make the game playable through network and
also somekind of super simple AI to play against is going to be in the works.

At the current state of the game:
- You can play pretty much only against yourself
- You can decide where to put your ships in the grid
- You can bomb away at the enemys grid
- After you have sunk all the ships, the game ends

The game will validate the ship and shot coordinates, but no actual bug
fixing is yet to be made. The game is ugly as balls for now, but it works.
